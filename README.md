## Help evil to fail

Not everything inaccessible should be made accessible. If a product or application is inherently exploitative or addictive, trades in misinformation and hatred, or just makes the world worse, do not help it to succeed or avoid litigation. Proprietors of such products do not deserve _any_ customers or users, least of all disabled or otherwise marginalized ones (who may be disproportionately effected by their f\*\*kery). Where you draw the line between acceptable and despicable is a question for your own moral compass. But you need to draw a line somewhere. It makes your identity as a designer more coherent and helps insulate you, personally, from having to deal with psychopaths. 

## Perfection is the enemy

Nothing is—nor can be—100% accessible. Anyone who claims their offering is completely accessible is a liar, or they don't understand accessibility, or both. Usually both. It's okay to deliver inaccessible work, so long as it’s more accessible than the last iteration and as accessible as you are able to make it, at the time, and within the given constraints. If the constraints are unreasonable, challenge those first. You may not feel confident you are the best person available to work on accessibility. The important thing is that you _are_ available. Don’t leave the work to absent (and nonexistent) accessibility superheroes. 

## By default or death

Accessibility fundamentally does not work as a plugin, add-on, or opt-in state. If you have to use an inaccessible interface to _enable_ accessibility, you’re doomed. A low-contrast switch that turns on high contrast? Game over. Categorically, accessibility overlay software does not and cannot work. Adding _accessibility stuff_ on top of inaccessible stuff does not address what needs to be addressed. The specific features offered by such third-party interlopers are immaterial. Resist the ideology of _post hoc_ accessibility at all costs. A Minimum Viable Product without accessibility is not—even minimally—viable. 

## Parity is paramount

The point is not to create a better experience, or even a good experience. It’s to ensure a _comparable_ experience. Interfaces should not be challenging to some and not to others. But some interfaces are necessarily complex and some content is inherently esoteric. You do not get to choose who can handle what. If an image serves as a joke, the alternative text should not give the joke away or explain why it is funny. It should be _telling the same joke by alternative means_. Not everyone will have the reference points to get the joke, but that’s someone else’s problem.

## What before how

They say form should follow function. But most organizations design first and develop second. The design phase consists of graphical ideation and leaves too many implementation questions unanswered. Often it is impossible to adapt the design effectively—least of all for accessibility. Drag-and-drop interfaces need to be operable by keyboard. This means buttons need to be provided. Those buttons will need to appear in the form we call the “design”. Accessibility specialists must be included in high-level design, because form must follow function and the function must be accessible. 

## Tools are not identities

Different screen reader users use different screen reader software in different ways for different reasons in different circumstances to meet different needs and preferences. That is, if they are using screen reader software at all. Disability is no more uniform than ability. There is no persona that can adequately exemplify a screen reader user or their behaviour. So you don’t design for screen reader users (or any other fictionalized homogenous group). Instead, you design to support the capabilites of screen reader software. People cannot—and should not—be quantified, but inputs and outputs can and should be.

## No points for performance

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, UK citizens applauded our frontline medical staff by congregating on our doorsteps to bang kitchenware together. My next-door neighbor, a doctor working grueling shifts, would be rudely awoken by the cacophony. Most accessibility-related endeavors I’ve encountered are performative only. Companies hire accessibility professionals and don’t give them the necessary resources. They commission research with disabled participants and refuse to interpret the feedback. They pay for audits and don’t implement the recommendations. If you want to make a real difference, demand praxis in place of performance.

## Less is less

The mantra “less is more” is incorrect. Less is just less and that's a good thing. Too much of interface engineering is done because others have done it or just to prove it can be done. Stop. The more we do, and the more complex the output becomes, the more likely it will fail. And not just by producing discrete errors and breakdowns; more importantly by resisting comprehension. Most components, in most cases, should just be content. Turning headings, paragraphs, and lists into an accessible tab interface is not an enhancement. It’s a degradation with bragging rights.
